# 🔧 Internship Project Summary

This repository contains four mini-projects developed in C as part of my internship. These tasks focus on fundamental concepts such as file handling, data structures, compiler design basics, and data compression techniques. Each program is written to be simple, practical, and beginner-friendly.

---

## 1. 📂 File Handling

This program demonstrates how to create, write, append, and read data from a file using C. It allows the user to input text, stores it in a file named `internship_output.txt`, appends more input, and finally reads and displays the content.

### 🔑 Key Concepts:
- File operations: `fopen()`, `fgets()`, `fputs()`, `fclose()`
- File modes: `"w"`, `"a"`, `"r"`
- Basic file input/output logic

---

## 2. 🔗 Linked List Implementation

This project includes a simple singly linked list using `struct` and pointers. The list supports inserting elements and displaying them. It shows how dynamic memory is used to build flexible data structures without fixed size.

### 🔑 Key Concepts:
- Structure definition with `struct`
- Dynamic memory allocation with `malloc()`
- Node linking using pointers

---

## 3. ⚙️ Lexical Analyzer (Compiler Design Basics)

This is a basic lexical analyzer that scans a C source file and identifies tokens like **keywords**, **identifiers**, and **operators**. It simulates the first phase of a compiler, helping understand how programming languages are parsed.

### 🔑 Key Concepts:
- Token detection (keywords, operators, identifiers)
- Character analysis using `isalpha()`, `isalnum()`
- String comparison using `strcmp()`

---

## 4. 🗜️ Data Compression Tool (Run-Length Encoding)

This tool compresses and decompresses text using Run-Length Encoding (RLE). It reduces repeated characters in a file, saving space. A decompress function restores the original content.

### 🔑 Key Concepts:
- Run-Length Encoding logic
- Compression and decompression in files
- File handling using `fscanf()`, `fprintf()`

---

## ✅ Conclusion

These tasks helped strengthen my core programming knowledge and gave me a deeper understanding of how low-level systems work. The projects are short, educational, and useful as beginner tools for learning C programming.

> 🗂️ Each program is available as a separate `.c` file in this repository.
